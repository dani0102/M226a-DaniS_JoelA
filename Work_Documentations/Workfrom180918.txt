Work from 18.09.2018
---------------------

Today we decided on our two last projects for this module,
one being a printservice where you can select color, size,
doublesided and printer, and the other, bigger one, being
a library program where you can see all books and dvds,
whether they are currently available or not, and also log
in as your user. We believe that now we can start working
on them to fullfill the competence raster.

There weren't a lot of problems, but we had to discuss a bit
to decide on a project that covers all competences. Starting
next week we'll work first on the printservice project and
after we finish that we'll move on to the library project.
