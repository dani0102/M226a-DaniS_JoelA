Work from 04.09.2018
---------------------------

Today we were able to show our program “BankbelegeSortieren”, which basically sorts 
out bankreceipts in created directories and deletes old ones afterwards. To this program 
we made a UML class diagram which also included the property files. For the testing we 
started out with Blackbox / Whitebox testing, in our code we could also show collections 
with ArrayList and exception-handling with log4j. Everything was uploaded on our GitHub repository. 
This day we didn’t face any problems our troubles, we could work with ease.
For next week we want to start with Basic Unit Tests and Threads. If we can fulfil those requirements, 
we have the first row completely filled and would continue with the second row.
