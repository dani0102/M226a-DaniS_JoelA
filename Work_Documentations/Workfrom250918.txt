Work from 25.09.2018
--------------------

Today we finished our print service programm and 
filled out the second row. Now we are working on
our library service program. We are starting 
with the login, which we plan on finishing until
next week.
On the printer service program we were struggling
a little with the unit tests, but were able to
overcome that problem.
For next week we have planned on creating the
inheritance, delegation and finish the uml
diagrams.
