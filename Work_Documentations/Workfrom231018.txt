Work from 23.10.2018
--------------------

We finished our library programm in the
break before Joel went to france. We showed
how the program functions, the class and
sequence diagrams and also our work 
documentation. Now the only thing that's 
left is for the teacher to read our work 
documentation and if that is alright, 
our competence skript would be completely
fullfilled.
