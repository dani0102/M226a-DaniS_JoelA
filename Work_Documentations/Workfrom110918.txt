Work from 11.09.2018
--------------------

Today we were able to show our sequence diagram of our 
bankreceipt program, show that we understand delegation, 
unit tests and a program with dices using dices. 
Afterwards we started thinking about the secod column. 
We'll try to cover all points of the second column 
with a PacMan game. We should be able to cover most of it,
but we are still trying to figure out how we'll implement
Lambda functions.

This was also our main problem, figure out how to work with
the PacMan program. Understanding the smaller parts like
delegation, aggregation, compositions, was no problem at all.
We used our own ideas, so we could be sure we understood it.

Our next steps would be trying to fille out the second column 
with the PacMan game. First we'll do the class diagram, so we
know what we need to do. At the same time, we will wirte down
ideas for our next bigger project, that will cover the 3rd column.
